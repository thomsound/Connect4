# Connect4

play on: https://thomsound.github.io/Connect4/

## Gameplay

In the original version the players try to connect 4 checkers in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row to win the game.
This implementation of the game allows you to play with more than two players and to vary the number of checkers to connect to win the game. You can adjust the size of the board as well. Whereas playing connect one might be rather boring it can be quite fun to set it up to sth. like connect three with four players.
